# Xmodmap Configuration
After using the MacBook for a while, I realized that the key behavior and the mouse scrolling was more natural in MacOS.

## What is this config file do?
* Remap modifier keys on Linux.
  - [Left Control] as [Left Win/Super]
  - [Left Win/Super] as [Left Alt]
  - [Left Alt] as [Left Control]
  - [Right Alt] as [CapsLock]

### Usage:
Just copy `.Xmodmap` to home directory (`~/`). Or you can copy this command:
```bash
cp .Xmodmap ~/
```
